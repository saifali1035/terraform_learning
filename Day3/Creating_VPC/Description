We have achived connectivity from bastion server to private instance
and private instance is able to connect to internet using NAT.

We also removed bastion host now as we are using Ec2 Instance Connect
with VPC endpoints.

Advantages -
No need of bastion host and its security group
No need to manage bastion host
Earlier a malware from bastion host could reach private server but not now.

Disadvantages what i think -
As we dont know Ec2 Instance Connect's Ip the ingress security group is
quite open
